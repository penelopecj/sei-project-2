## Deployment
I deployed this website on Netlify and it is available at [recipe-allergies.netlify.app](https://recipe-allergies.netlify.app/).

## Concept
**Can I Eat This** is a site where users can select their allergies and dietary restrictions from a list, then input any recipe URL from the web. The site will produce a list of the user's allergens that are contained in the recipe.
