# üç™ Can I Eat This? - A Front-end React App
A React app built during a 48hr hackathon. Uses the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). My first pair project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.
### Developed by:
* Alberto Cerrone - [GitHub](https://github.com/albertocerrone)

## Deployment
I deployed this website on Netlify and it is available [_here_](https://recipe-allergies.netlify.app/).

## Concept
**Can I Eat This** is a site where users can select their allergies and dietary restrictions from a list, then input any recipe URL from the web. The site will produce a list of the user's allergens that are contained in the recipe.

## Project #2 Brief: Reacathon
* 48 hours to build a React application that consumes a public API.
* Public API could have been anything, but needed to make sense for our project.
* Have several components, including at least one classical and one functional.
* The app can have a router with several "pages", which was up to our disgression if it made sense for our project.
* Include wireframes that we designed before building the app.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to our hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* A working request in Insomnia from the API we want to use, showing that we can access the dataset we need.
## Technologies Used
* **API**:
  * [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
* **Frontend**:
  * JavaScript (ES6)
  * React.js
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Axios
  * Bulma
* **Development Tools**:

  * Git + GitHub
  * Insomnia
  * Live Share
  * Netlify
## Installation Instructions
1. Clone repo code from GitHub onto your machine.
2. Use `yarn` or `npm` to install all dependencies from the `package.json` file.

## User Stories & Wireframes

**Basic User Story**

## General Approach & Planning
* We first had to choose an API we wanted to use. My partner and I realised we both have a passion for fine food and love to try new recipes, so we decided to use the very popular [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

**API of our choice**

* We began by chatting through a very basic user story and wireframe of our apps design and components, given the limited time we had.
* We wrote throwaway code to explain our thought process to each other and to solve short term problems.
* We first took the time to read the docs for Bulma and the Spoonacular API we were using.
* We decided to pair code most of the app on VS Code Live Share so we could pool or knowledge and get more built quickly in the short time we had.
* We began by writing pseudocode before writing actual code to help us think through the logic first.
* We weren't too concerned with writing DRY code at the time, as we wanted to achieve a lot of functionality in 48 hours. We decided we would come back to re-factor repetitive code later on.
* We discussed and agreed on consistent code styles, indentation, and naming conventions.
* We made sure to commit early and often in case we broke something and needed to roll back to a previous version.
* We kept our user stories small and well-defined, trying to always come back to what our target user would actually want and need.

## Wins


## Challenges Overcome


## Key Learnings


## Unsolved Problems


## Features Wish List
* We didn't have time in the short hackathon, but the dream is to convert this into a Chrome browser extension that could check the ingredients on any recipe when you arrive on the page.
